# Computer Vision
This project is an attempt to use Python3 to interact with a computer screen.

Currently, development is in the direction of using my video camera to find key points on my hand. Once the hand is found, I can identify the tip of my index finger. I can then use this point's location relative to the video camera bounds and operate my mouse.
